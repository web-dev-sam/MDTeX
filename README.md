### First Setup
1. Open repo in vscode dev container
2. Run `npm i`
3. Click on "Build MDTeX" *(wait for it to finish)*
4. Click on "Generate PDF" *(first run may fail due to missing packages, run again after)*
5. Save `main.md`
6. If it fails to generate PDF, try
   - Running the latex command in terminal
   - Restarting VSCode

### Workflow after First Setup
1. Open VSCode
2. Edit `main.md`
3. Save *(Save twice to see metadata updates like table of contents, why? because latex is great)*
